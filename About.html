            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I'm Tyler Marks, an actor currently immersed in the world of musical theater at MSU. My journey in acting has been shaped by various training programs, including the Michigan School of Film in Detroit. I hail from the cozy town of Wixom, just a short 30-minute drive from the vibrant city of Detroit. Growing up with a brother and a watchful older sister, sports played a big role in my life.
